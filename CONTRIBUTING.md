# Contributing to Faust-Prometheus

Documentation for Faust-Prometheus is available in the Faust-Prometheus [repo]( https://github.com/woodmac/Faust-Prometheus/README.md )

The Faust-Prometheus team is following a very simple branching model.  We use [master](https://github.com/woodmac/Faust-Prometheus/tree/master) as the production branch and all other branches for features or bugs. We do not maintain a dev only branch, staging, etc.  

Contributions will be accepted to the [master](https://github.com/woodmac/Faust-Prometheus/tree/master) only.

## How to provide a pull request/patch for a new feature

1. If it is a major feature, please create an [Issue]( https://github.com/woodmac/Faust-Prometheus/issues ) and discuss it with the project leaders. 

2. If in step 1 you get an acknowledgement from the project leaders, use the
   following procedure to submit a pull request:

    a. Fork Faust-Prometheus on github ( http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/ )

    b. Create a topic branch (git checkout -b my_branch)
    
    c. Make changes to code in your branch

    d. Push to your branch (git push origin my_branch)

    e. Initiate a pull request on github ( http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/ )

    f. We'll review your pull request and merge when approved!

For minor fixes just create a patch to the [master]( https://github.com/woodmac/Faust-Prometheus/tree/master ) branch on Github.
